                I'm from Dhaka, Bangladeshâ€”a city known for its vibrant culture
                and rich history. I'm passionate about coding, and I enjoy exploring new ideas
                and learning every day. When I'm not busy with work or studies,
                I enjoy exploring new places and capturing memories through photography, also exploring new technologies. 
               
              </p>
              <p> Life, for me, is an adventure, and I'm always excited to see where the next journey takes me! I'm always open to meeting new people and sharing experiences,
              so feel free to connect!</p>
